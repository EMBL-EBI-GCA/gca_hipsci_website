The HipSci project is generating IPS cell lines from cohorts of patients with
inherited genetic diseases.  IPSC technology provides opportunity for modelling
human genetic diseases in the culture dish, for developing therapeutic agents
and for screening of potential drugs.  Cell lines reprogrammed from the somatic
cells of disease-carrying tissue donors can be differentiated into the
disease-relevant tissues, which are not otherwise easily obtained from patients.

The HipSci collection of cell lines also includes a large number from
phenotypically 'normal' donors, with no diagnosed genetic disease. Cell
lines from phenotypically normal donors allows the study of how common
genetic variations affect the cellular
phenotypes.
