You can use our [cell lines and data browser](/lines/#/lines) to browse the files belonging to any of our current datasets:

* Select the [Files](/lines/#/files) tab at the top of the cell lines and data browser
* Type the dataset identifier into the search box above the table e.g. EGAD00001001933. The table will now display only files present in your chosen dataset.
* Use the More columns button to optionally display the dataset accession, or file names.
* Use the Export button to download a list of files in the dataset

Alternatively, you can use the HipSci FTP site to download complete lists of all files in any dataset, including non-current datasets.
