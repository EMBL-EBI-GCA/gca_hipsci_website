As part of our QC selection process, all lines are submitted for [genotyping (gtarray)](/assay/gtarray) and [microarray (gexarray)](/assay/gexarray). Only lines that pass QC and are 'selected', will then proceed for [RNA sequencing (rnaseq)](/assay/rnaseq), [Whole Exome Sequencing (exomeseq)](/assay/exomeseq), [DNA methylation (mtarray)](/assay/mtarray), [proteomics (proteomics)](/assay/proteomics) and [cellular phenotyping (cellbiol-fn)](/assay/cellbiol-fn). For some of our normal healthy donors, you will also find whole exome sequencing data for the parent fibroblast.

We also have whole genome sequencing data available for the parent fibroblasts and the iPSC lines for a subset of ~150 donors.
