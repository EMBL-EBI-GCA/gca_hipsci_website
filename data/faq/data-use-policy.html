<h3>What is HipSci's data use policy?</h3>
<p>HipSci project data are being released early, prior to their publication, in the expectation that they will be valuable for many researchers. In keeping with Fort Lauderdale principles, data users may use the data for many studies, but are expected to allow the data producers to make the first presentations and to publish the first papers with global analyses of the data.</p>

<p><strong>Global analyses of Project data</strong></p>
<p>The HipSci project will publish global analyses of the sequence data and quality, SNPs, transcript expression, DNA methylation and proteomics, including genetic studies of these. Talks, posters, and papers on all such analyses are to be published first by the HipSci Consortium, by approved presenters on behalf of the Project, with the Consortium as author. After the HipSci consortium has published analyses, then researchers inside and outside the Project are free to present and publish using the Project data for these analyses.</p>

<p><strong>Methods development using Project data</strong></p>
<p>Researchers who have used small amounts of Project data (<= one chromosome) may present methods development posters, talks, and papers that include these data prior to the first major HipSci Project paper, without needing Project approval or authorship, although the Project should be acknowledged. Methods presentations or papers on global analyses or analyses using large amounts of Project data, on topics that the Consortium plans to examine, would be similar to large-scale analyses of Project data: researchers within the Project may make presentations or submit papers at the same time as the main Project presentations and papers, and others could do so after the Project publishes analysis papers.</p>

<p><strong>Population comparisons using Project data</strong></p>
<p>Researchers may use Project data as controls or additional information for comparisons with their samples from other populations, prior to the major Project paper being published, as long as the analyses that the Project plans to do are not included. These are not Project studies, and the Project should not be listed as an author.</p>
