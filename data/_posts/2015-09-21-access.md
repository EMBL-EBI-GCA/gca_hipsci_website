title: Open access and managed access data
---

HipSci data fall into two broad categories designated as 'Individually unique'
where the data are unique to the sample donor; and ‘Non-unique’ where the data
are not uniquely linkable to the sample donor. Furthermore, HipSci donors fall
into two categories: 'Managed' or 'Open' access.

The following statements are guidelines only. We have policy documents
describing how to manage these data types. Contact hipsci-dcc@ebi.ac.uk for
information.

Individually unique data from managed access donors must be treated as
secure data.  Individually unique data from open access donors may be
distributed openly.  Any non-unique data may be distributed openly,
including for managed access and open access donors.

Y chromosome genetic data is treated as managed access for all samples,
including for those with open data consent. Y chromosome data are stripped from
any file in an open access data archive.
