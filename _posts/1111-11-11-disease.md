The HipSci project is generating iPS cell lines from cohorts of patients with inherited genetic diseases.
iPSC technology provides opportunity for modelling human disease in the culture dish.

The HipSci collection of cell lines also includes a large number from
phenotypically 'normal' donors, with no diagnosed genetic disease. Cell
lines from phenotypically normal donors allows the study of how common
genetic variations affect the cellular
phenotypes.
