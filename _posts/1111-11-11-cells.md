title: HipSci cell lines
---

HipSci is generating a large, high-quality reference panel of human iPSC lines. A key
component of our program is the systematic generation of IPSCs from hundreds of
donors using a standardised experimental pipeline.

The large scale of the HipSci project sets it apart from the majority of studies to date,
which have typically generated iPSCs from only tens of individuals.

IPSC lines are generated for hundreds of healthy donors, plus several cohorts of donors
with inherited genetic diseases.

our derivation pipeline, and how to obtain a cell line.
