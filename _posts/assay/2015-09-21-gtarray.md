HipSci assays for genotypes in all iPS cell lines and in the primary
tissue cells from which they were derived (e.g. fibroblasts). HipSci's QC procedure is to
compare the called genotypes between the primary and derived cells of the
same donor, to ensure genomic integrity in the derived lines.

###Assay procedure
(link to relevant SOP in ftp site)
HumanHT 12v4 Expression BeadChip

###Analysis
The following command lines are used to analyse the data:

(CNV analysis)

###Data
The following data files are generated by genotyping assays and their analysis:
*   Raw data in Genotyping console gtc format
*   Initial vcf file
*   Imputed and phased vcf files

All data are made availble in public data archives:
*   [Managed-access]({{'/data/access' | prepend: site.baseurl}}) data are archived in EGA.
*   [Open-access]({{'/data/access' | prepend: site.baseurl}}) data are archived in EVA.
