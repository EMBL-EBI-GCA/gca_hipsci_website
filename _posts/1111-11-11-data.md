title: HipSci's rich data
---

As IPSC lines are increasingly being used as patient-specific disease models,
it is crucial to understand the sources of biological variability and
heterogeneity in these lines.

Each line generated by HipSci is extensively characterised, with all
genetic and phenotypic data freely available
for use by the wider research community.

* Systematic characterisation of hundreds of IPSC lines
* Extensive genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and cellular phenotyping
* Meta data: donor demographics and cell line derivation methods

A key feature of HipSci's experimental design is the derivation and
characterisation of multiple IPSC lines for each individual. This enables us to
quantify the fraction of IPSC cellular variation attributable to donor effects,
and to map common genetic variants that affect variability in gene expression
between IPSC lines.
