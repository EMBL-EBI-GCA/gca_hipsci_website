The Wellcome Trust and Medical Research Council (MRC) today announced a £12.75
million initiative to create a catalogue of high-quality adult stem cells,
so-called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells). The initiative will
provide a knowledge-base to underpin the use of such cells in studying the
effects of our genes on health and disease and lay the foundations to create a
new iPS cell bank, providing a world-class resource for UK researchers.
