title: HipSci calls for Rare Disease case proposals
---

We are seeking clinicians (or scientists with access to relevant patient cases)
to provide samples from patients with inherited genetic diseases for the
disease component of the HipSci project. We request that samples are provided
in groups of between 10 and 50 with related phenotypes, and that all samples
already have the genetic defect identified (the aim is to support gene analysis
rather than gene discovery), with typically multiple cases with defects in the
same gene. We encourage clinicians/scientists with only small numbers of
samples to form larger groups with others who can contribute similar cases.

If you wish to submit a proposal or have any questions please email
[hipsci-proposal@ebi.ac.uk](mailto:hipsci-proposal@ebi.ac.uk)
