HipSci brings  together diverse constituents in genomics, proteomics, cell
biology and clinical genetics to create a UK national iPS cell resource and use
it to carry out cellular genetic studies.

Between 2013 and 2017 we aim to generate over 500 iPS cell lines from healthy
volunteers and several hundred lines from individuals with genetic disease. We
are then using these cell lines to discover how genomic variation impacts on
cellular phenotype and identify new disease mechanisms.

Strong links with NHS investigators ensure that studies on the
disease-associated cell lines will be linked to extensive clinical information.
Further key features of the project are an open access model of data sharing;
engagement of the wider clinical genetics community in selecting patient
samples; and provision of dedicated laboratory space for collaborative cell
phenotyping and differentiation.
