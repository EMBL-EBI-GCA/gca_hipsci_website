[Ludovic](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/faculty/lvallier/) uses human
pluripotent stem cells - cells with the ability to develop into almost any type
of cell in the body - to study how biological mechanisms direct them to become
a pancreas or liver cell. He is also investigating the role these mechanisms
play in diabetes and other metabolic disorders.
