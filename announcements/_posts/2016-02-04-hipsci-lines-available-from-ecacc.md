title: HipSci cell lines are available from ECACC
---

The first five IPS cell lines from HipSci are now available from [ECACC](https://www.phe-culturecollections.org.uk/products/celllines/hipsci/index.jsp).
Scientists can now obtain quality-certified HipSci cell lines to conduct their own
academic research.

Take a look at the [ECACC website](https://www.phe-culturecollections.org.uk/products/celllines/hipsci/index.jsp) to see the HipSci collection.

HipSci has a banking arrangement with
ECACC (European Collection of Cell Cultures) for distribution of all our
IPS cell lines to academic researchers. This first release of five cell
lines is just the start of our commitment to making all HipSci IPS cell lines
available in this way. Over 50 additional lines are going through final tests
prior to making them available.

HipSci has a separate banking arrangement with [EBiSC](http://www.ebisc.org/) for the disribution of
some cell lines to commercial (as well as academic) researchers. If you are a
commercial researcher then check back here soon for further announcements.

Cells lines in our [HipSci data browser]({{site.baseurl}}/lines) are marked
with their current 'banking status'. You can filter to display only lines that
are currently available from ECACC.

If you require a large panel of different HipSci lines (20 plus) then contact ECACC (culturecollections@phe.gov.uk) for a special quotation.
