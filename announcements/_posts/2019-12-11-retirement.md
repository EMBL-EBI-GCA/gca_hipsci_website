# HipSci Website Retirement

The HipSci website and data portal will be decommissioned on 30th March 2020, as it has unfortunately not been possible to secure a long-term hosting solution for the site.

All of the cell lines generated during the HipSci project will continue to be purchasable from ECACC, with the complete HipSci collection browsable for purchase from their [website](https://www.phe-culturecollections.org.uk/products/celllines/hipsci/index.jsp). For any queries relating to the purchase of cell lines please contact the ECACC culture collection [help desk](https://www.phe-culturecollections.org.uk/contactus/index.aspx).

All of the ‘omics data generated by the HipSci project will also continue to be available from the EMBL-EBI public archives. The HipSci BioSamples all now have links to all of the ‘omics datasets generated on them as part of the metadata record. To browse and access the HipSci samples see the HipSci portal, where you can continue to filter by a range of metadata characteristics such as disease state. You can access all of the sample records from the [BioSamples website](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/samples?filter=attr%3Aproject%3AHipSci).

Over the coming months we will continue to prepare for the deprecation of the data portal. We are currently investigating the addition of BioSamples or BioStudies for each disease that will collate together all of the sample links from that group. Please check back to this page before 30th March 2020 for further details.

The [HipSci helpdesk](hipsci@ebi.ac.uk) will close on 30th March 2020 and all future queries should be directed to [ECACC](https://www.phe-culturecollections.org.uk/contactus/index.aspx).

We appreciate the support and interest from the community in the HipSci collection and hope that through continued sale of the cell lines from ECACC and the data availability from the underlying EMBL-EBI archives that the collection can continue to be of significant benefit to the community.
