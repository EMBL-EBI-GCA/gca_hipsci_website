We are looking to hear from clinicians (or scientist with access to relevant
patient cases) working with patients with inherited genetic diseases, where a
collection of disease causing mutations has already been identified, and the
group would be interested in having iPS lines generated from some of your
patients that you would use in further studies.

Please note that at this stage this is only an Expression of Interest and not a
final call for proposals. The results will allow us to plan the use our
remaining resources most efficiently.

Please contact us if you have a group of (between 10 and 50) patients with
related phenotypes where you would be able to provide us with patient material
(either fibroblasts or a skin biopsy).

Please see the HipSci Rare Disease [Expression of interest page]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2015-04-28-ips-cells-rare-disease-expression-interest%}) for more
information. The details can also be found in the [Expression of Interest PDF]({{site.baseurl}}/documents/hipsci_rare_disease_expression_20150428.pdf).
The Expression of Interest should be submitted to [hipsci-proposal@ebi.ac.uk](mailto:hipsci-proposal@ebi.ac.uk)
before 3rd July 2015.
