title: HipSci Bardet-Biedl syndrome cell lines are available from ECACC
---

Twenty-Seven Bardet-Biedl syndrome iPS cell lines from HipSci are now available from [ECACC](https://www.phe-culturecollections.org.uk/products/celllines/hipsci/index.jsp).  These tissue samples were contributed to the HipSci project by University College London.

Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a ciliopathy with multisystem involvement.  It is an inherited genetic disorder, for which mutations in many different genes can be responsible.  HipSciâ€™s BBS cell lines come from individuals in which the disease-causing mutation is not in the same gene across the cohort of individuals.  For more information on the Bardet-Biedl syndrome cell lines please see the [Bardet-Biedl section of our HipSci data browser.]({{site.baseurl}}/disease/bardet-biedl)

Scientists can now obtain over two hundred quality-certified HipSci cell lines to conduct their own academic research.  Cells lines in our [HipSci data browser]({{site.baseurl}}/lines) are marked
with their current 'banking status'. You can filter to display only lines that are currently available from ECACC.

If you require a large panel of different HipSci lines (20 plus) then contact ECACC (culturecollections@phe.gov.uk) for a special quotation.
