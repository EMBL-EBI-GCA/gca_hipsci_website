title: Common genetic variation drives molecular heterogeneity in human iPSCs preprint available in BioRxiv
---

The first major analysis of the [HipSci cell line data](http://www.hipsci.org/lines/#/lines) is now availiable as a pre-print in [BioRxiv](http://biorxiv.org/)

[Common genetic variation drives molecular heterogeneity in human iPSCs  
doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/055160](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/05/25/055160) 

Here, we describe the systematic generation, genotyping and phenotyping of 522 open access human iPSCs derived from 189 healthy male and female individuals. 

Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the major sources of genetic and phenotypic variation in iPSCs and establishes their suitability for use in genetic studies of complex human traits and cancer.
