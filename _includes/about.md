and what is being undertaken"* (from the oversight group feedback)

HipSci brings  together diverse constituents in genomics, proteomics, cell
biology and clinical genetics to create a UK national iPS cell resource and use
it to carry out cellular genetic studies.

Between 2013 and 2016 we aim to generate iPS cells from over 500  healthy
individuals and 500 individuals with genetic disease. We will then use these
cells to discover how genomic variation impacts on cellular phenotype and
identify new disease mechanisms.

Strong links with NHS investigators will ensure that studies on the
disease-associated cell lines will be linked to extensive clinical information.
Further key features of the project are an open access model of data sharing;
engagement of the wider clinical genetics community in selecting patient
samples; and provision of dedicated laboratory space for collaborative cell
phenotyping and differentiation.
