The Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Initiative (HipSci) is
generating a large, high-quality reference panel of human IPSC lines.

HipSci stands apart from other IPSC projects in a number or respects:

* **Its magnitude** -- HipSci is systematcially generating IPSCs from hundreds of donors using a standardised experimental pipeline.
* **Cell line availability** -- HipSci's cell lines are intended as a national IPSC resource. The cell lines and their accompanying genetic and phenotypic data are free available for use by the wider research community.
* **Disease cohorts** -- HipSci's reference panel comprises hundreds of cell lines from phenotypically normal donors, plus several cohorts of donors with inherited genetic diseases.
* **The data** -- Each line generated is extensively characterised. Assays include genotyping by array, expression array, methylation array, RNA-seq, Exome-seq, proteomics mass spectrometry, and high content cellular phenotyping.
