## Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells

Reprogramming of somatic human cells to a pluripotent state was first reported
in 2008. In the original study, pluripotency was induced by ectopic expression
of four specific transcription factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and MYC; also known
as the Yamanaka factors), which trigger widespread changes in the epigenomes
and transcriptional programs of the target cells and ultimately permanently
reset their cellular state. Such cells are called *induced
pluripotent stem cells* (iPSC).
