The cellular phenotyping project at KCL is evaluating how iPSCs respond to chemical,
physical and biological stimuli.
A high-content platform has been developed using novel assays and artificial
stimuli to analyse iPSC behaviour in different microenvironments.
These data contribute to HipSci's research into the dependence of phenotypic variance
on genetic and epigenetic variance.

##Assay procedure

Undifferentiated iPSCs are enzymatically dissociated and
seeded as single cells onto 96-well plates. They are coated with different ECM proteins
including fibronectin, collagen, and vitronectin. The plates
are stained and then imaged using an Operetta high content device.

This method allows assessment of cell number,
proliferation, cell morphology and intercellular adhesion properties.

##Getting the data

The results of the cellular phenotyping experiments are distributed as pdf files
on the HipSci [FTP site](ftp://ftp.hipsci.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data/cellbiol-fn/pdf/).

Complete lists of cellular phenotyping data can be found under the files tab of
the [cell lines and data browser]({{'/lines/#/files?Assay[]=Cellular%20phenotyping' | prepend: site.baseurl}}).
