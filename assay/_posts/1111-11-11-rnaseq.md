###Data

The following data files are generated by RNA sequencing and its analysis:

*   Raw sequencing data in cram format
*   Bam files realigned with the STAR aligner

All data are made availble in public data archives:

*   [Managed-access]({{'/data/access' | prepend: site.baseurl}}) data are archived in EGA.
*   [Open-access]({{'/data/access' | prepend: site.baseurl}}) data are archived in ENA.
