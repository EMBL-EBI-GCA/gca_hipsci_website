Transcription profiling by array is used to measure the activity of genes in
the HipSci cell lines.

HipSci assays the transcriptome espression profile in all iPS cell lines and in the
primary tissue cells (e.g. fibroblasts).  HipSci's QC procedure uses transcript
expression to ensure that derived cell lines have a profile typical of the
pluripotent state.

###Assay procedure

(link to relevant SOP in ftp site)

HumanHT 12v4 Expression BeadChip

###Analysis

The following command lines are used to analyse the data:

(Pluritest analysis)

###Data

The following data files are generated by transcription profiling assays and their analysis:

*   Primary data in Illumina idat format
*   Genome studio text files
*   Imputed and phased vcf files

All data are made availble in public data archives:

*   [Managed-access]({{'/data/access' | prepend: site.baseurl}}) data are archived in EGA.
*   [Open-access]({{'/data/access' | prepend: site.baseurl}}) data are archived in ArrayExpress.
