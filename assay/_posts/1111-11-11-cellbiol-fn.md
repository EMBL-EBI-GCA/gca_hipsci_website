The cell phenotyping project at KCL aims to discover how genetic variation
contributes to variation in cell behaviour. We thus measure how cells respond
to specific extrinsic stimuli that represent key components of the stem cell
microenvironment (niche) in vivo (Lane et al, 2014, Nature Biotech, in press).

Quantitative assays have been developed for undifferentiated iPSCs, dissociated
enzymatically and plated in 96 well plates, for the following cell responses:
cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion (Figure 2), cell-cell adhesion,
proliferation, apoptosis and maintenance of pluripotency. We have developed
techniques for altering two environmental stimuli: ECM composition and
growth factor availability. Each condition is assayed in triplicate wells and
each cell line is assayed in triplicate experiments
