Exome sequencing is performed on all HipSci iPS cell lines selected for banking after passing QC.

###Assay procedure
(link to relevant SOP in ftp site)

SureSelect  Human All Exon v5 target enrichment

###Analysis
The following command lines are used to analyse the data:

###Data
The following data files are generated by RNA sequencing and its analysis:
*   Raw sequencing data in cram format
*   Initial variant calls in vcf format using mpileup / bcftools
*   Imputed and phased genotypes using Impute2 and Shapeit

All data are made availble in public data archives:
*   All [Managed-access]({{'/data/access' | prepend: site.baseurl}}) data are archived in EGA.
*   [Open-access]({{'/data/access' | prepend: site.baseurl}}) sequencing data are archived in ENA.
*   [Open-access]({{'/data/access' | prepend: site.baseurl}}) variant calls are archived in EVA.
