title: Methylation array
---

Methylation profiling by array is used to probe the methylation pattern of DNA, which is a suppressor of gene activity.

HipSci assays iPS cell lines that are selected for banking after passed QC.

###Assay procedure
(link to relevant SOP in ftp site)

HumanMethylation450 BeadChip v1.0

###Analysis
The following command lines are used to analyse the data:

(Pluritest analysis)

###Data
The following data files are generated by transcription profiling assays and their analysis:
*   Primary data in Illumina idat format
*   Text files with probe intensities

All data are made availble in public data archives:
*   [Managed-access]({{'/data/access' | prepend: site.baseurl}}) data are archived in EGA.
*   [Open-access]({{'/data/access' | prepend: site.baseurl}}) data are archived in ArrayExpress.
