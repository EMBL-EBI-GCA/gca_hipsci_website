The proteomics project at Dundee
has developed and validated efficient protocols for working with
protein samples extracted from frozen iPSC lines. This reduced time and cell
culture costs by minimizing the number of cells needed and avoiding having to
amplify the cells.

We have developed a
proteomics quantification strategy for HipSci, enabling quantitative proteome
comparisons between lines using a relative quantification approach.

To assess data quality, we have carried out comparisons between technical and 
biological replicates (proteome abundance) and the corresponding
mRNA levels across multiple HipSci lines.
