###Abstract

Self-renewing stem cell populations are increasingly considered as resources
for cell therapy and tools for drug discovery. Human pluripotent stem (hPS)
cells in particular offer a virtually unlimited reservoir of homogeneous cells
and can be differentiated toward diverse lineages. Many diseases show
impairment in self-renewal or differentiation, abnormal lineage choice or other
aberrant cell behavior in response to chemical or physical cues. To investigate
these responses, there is a growing interest in the development of specific
assays using hPS cells, artificial microenvironments and high content analysis.
Several hurdles need to be overcome that can be grouped into three areas: (i)
availability of robust, homogeneous, and consistent cell populations as a
starting point; (ii) appropriate understanding and use of chemical and physical
microenvironments; (iii) development of assays that dissect the complexity of
cell populations in tissues while mirroring specific aspects of their behavior.
Here we review recent progress in the culture of hPS cells and we detail the
importance of the environment surrounding the cells with a focus on synthetic
material and suitable high content analysis approaches. The technologies
described, if properly combined, have the potential to create a paradigm shift
in the way diseases are modeled and drug discovery is performed.
