###Abstract

Most image analysis pipelines rely on multiple channels per image with
subcellular reference points for cell segmentation. Single-channel
phase-contrast images are often problematic, especially for cells with
unfavorable morphology, such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Live
imaging poses a further challenge, because of the introduction of the dimension
of time. Evaluations cannot be easily integrated with other biological data
sets including analysis of endpoint images. Here, we present a workflow that
incorporates a novel CellProfiler-based image analysis pipeline enabling
segmentation of single-channel images with a robust R-based software solution
to reduce the dimension of time to a single data point. These two packages
combined allow robust segmentation of iPSCs solely on phase-contrast
single-channel images and enable live imaging data to be easily integrated to
endpoint data sets while retaining the dynamics of cellular responses. The
described workflow facilitates characterization of the response of live-imaged
iPSCs to external stimuli and definition of cell lineâ€“specific, phenotypic
signatures. We present an efficient tool set for automated high-content
analysis suitable for cells with challenging morphology. This approach has
potentially widespread applications for human pluripotent stem cells and other
cell types.
