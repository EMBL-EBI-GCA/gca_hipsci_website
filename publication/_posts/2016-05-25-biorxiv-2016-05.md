###Abstract

Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology has enormous potential to
provide improved cellular models of human disease. However, variable genetic
and phenotypic characterisation of many existing iPSC lines limits their
potential use for research and therapy. Here, we describe the systematic
generation, genotyping and phenotyping of 522 open access human iPSCs derived
from 189 healthy male and female individuals as part of the Human Induced
Pluripotent Stem Cells Initiative (HipSci: [http://www.hipsci.org](http://www.hipsci.org)).
Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the major sources of genetic and
phenotypic variation in iPSCs and establishes their suitability for use in
genetic studies of complex human traits and cancer. Using a combination of
genome-wide analyses we find that 5-25% of the variation in different iPSC
phenotypes, including differentiation capacity and cellular morphology, arises
from differences between individuals. We also assess the phenotypic effects of
rare, genomic copy number mutations that are recurrently seen following iPSC
reprogramming and present an initial map of common regulatory variants
affecting the transcriptome of pluripotent cells in humans.
