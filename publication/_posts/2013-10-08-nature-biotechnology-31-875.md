###Abstract

Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are the focus of intense research
because of their potential to provide patient-specific cell therapies and to
model human disease. Small numbers of control and disease-specific hiPSC lines
are publicly available, but they rarely have full data sets that include
genomic, epigenomic and detailed patient phenotype data. With the
global thrust to generate and exploit hiPSCs, several initiatives are emerging
that aim to generate collections of hundreds to thousands of cell lines and to
address the associated scientific, technical and financial challenges.
In light of these efforts, we consider whether such large collections are
worthwhile, highlight some of the potential problems associated with them and
suggest some solutions.
