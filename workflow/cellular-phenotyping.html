<h3>Cellular phenotyping assays </h3>
<p>HipSci's cellular phenotyping assays are carried out at Kingâ€™s College London, at the Centre for Stem Cells & Regenerative Medicine. Imaging the HipSci cell lines and using high content analysis, we quantify and standardise phenotypic features that are informative of cell behaviour in an artificial microenvironment. Methods have been developed to facilitate the integration of dynamic and end-point imaging data, with genomics and proteomics data. This allows for the study of genetic contribution on cellular phenotype, and the association of single nucleotide changes to parameters such as cell adhesion, morphology and proliferation.</p>
