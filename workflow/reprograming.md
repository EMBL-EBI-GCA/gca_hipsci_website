Fibroblasts and PBMCs are transduced using the Cytotune 2.0 Sendai virus (containing genes encoding the Yamanaka factors Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc and Klf4).

Successful colonies are picked and cultured to obtain a stock of iPS cells. These iPSC lines are then banked to a commercial grade standard, and must pass resuscitation and mycoplasma tests to be deposited at our partner cell banks, ECACC and EBiSC.
