Fibroblasts and PBMCs are transduced using the Cytotune 2.0 Sendai virus (containing the Yamanaka genes encoding transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, cMyc and Klf4).

Successful colonies are picked and cultured to obtain a sizable yield of IPS cells. These iPSC lines are then banked to a commercial grade standard, and must pass resuscitation and mycoplasma tests to be deposited at our partner cell banks, ECACC and EBiSC.
