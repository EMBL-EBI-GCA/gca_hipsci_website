The HipSci project has worked closely with many clinicians across the UK to secure patient samples for the derivation of iPSCs. HipSci lines are created from tissue donations from both healthy volunteers, and patients from particular rare disease communities.

The cohorts in which patients have been recruited into are:

* Healthy individuals
* Bardet-Biedl syndrome
* Alport syndrome
* Hereditary Cerebellar Ataxia
* Congenital Hyperinsulinia
* Kabuki syndrome
* Primary immune deficiency
* Bleeding and Platelet disorders
* Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
* Usher syndrome and Congenital eye defects
* Monogenic Diabetes
* Batten disease
* Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia
* Retinitis Pigmentosa
* Macular Dystrophy
* Childhood Neurology
