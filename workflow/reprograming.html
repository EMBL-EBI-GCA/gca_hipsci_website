<h3>iPSC reprogramming</h3>
<p>Fibroblasts and PBMCs are transduced using the Cytotune 2.0 Sendai virus (containing the Yamanaka genes encoding transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, cMyc and Klf4).</p>
<p>Successful colonies are picked and cultured to obtain a sizable yield of IPS cells. These iPSC lines are then banked to a commercial grade standard, and must pass resuscitation and mycoplasma tests to be deposited at our partner cell banks, ECACC and EBiSC.</p>
