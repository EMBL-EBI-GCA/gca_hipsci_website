<h3>Genetic and Genomics assays</h3>

<p><strong>Gexarray=<span class="blue">Expression array</span></strong></p>
<p>Transcription profiling by array is used to measure the activity of genes in the HipSci cell lines. HipSci assays the transcriptome expression profile in all iPS cell lines and in the primary tissue cells (e.g. fibroblasts). HipSci's QC procedure uses transcript expression to ensure that derived cell lines have a profile typical of the pluripotent state.</p>

<p><strong>Gtarray= <span class="blue">Genotyping array</span></strong></p>
<p>HipSci assays for genotypes in all iPS cell lines and in the primary tissue cells from which they were derived (e.g. fibroblasts). HipSci's QC procedure compares the called genotypes between the primary and derived cells of the same donor, to ensure genomic integrity in the derived lines.</p>

<p><strong>Exomeseq= <span class="blue">Exome sequencing </span></strong></p>
<p>Exome sequencing is performed on all HipSci iPS cell lines selected for banking after passing QC. We have also generated exome sequencing data for ~250 healthy normal parent fibroblasts. Sequencing and primary analysis are performed at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.</p>

<p><strong>Rnaseq=<span class="blue">RNA sequencing </span></strong></p>
<p>RNA-sequencing is performed on all HipSci iPS cell lines selected for banking after passing QC. Sequencing and primary analysis are performed at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.</p>

<p><strong>Mtarray=<span class="blue">Methylation array </span></strong></p>
<p>Methylation profiling by array is used to probe the methylation pattern of DNA, which is a suppressor of gene activity. HipSci assays iPS cell lines that are selected for banking after passing QC. This assay and primary analysis is performed at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.</p>

<p><strong>Wgs=<span class="blue">Whole genome sequencing</span></strong></p>
 <p> A small selection of cell lines and their parent cell (i.e fibroblast) been selected for deep whole genome sequencing by Illumina XTen (~150 donors).  </p>
