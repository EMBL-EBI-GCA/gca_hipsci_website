<h3>Cell banking</h3>
<p>
As HipSciâ€™s cell lines are produced as a global iPSC resource, they are readily available for use by the wider research community.
Our banking agreement with two cell banks, ensure academic researchers can obtain our iPSC lines from the HipSci collection at ECACC, and commercial entities from EBiSC (also supply to academia).
