<h3>Quality Control </h3>
<p>The HipSci project runs two quality control assays (QC) on all successful candidate cell lines from each donor, and on the somatic cells that were used to derive it (fibroblasts or PBMC). From this QC, HipSci assesses pluripotency and genetic stability of the lines and selects suitable cell lines for banking at ECACC and EBiSC.</p>
