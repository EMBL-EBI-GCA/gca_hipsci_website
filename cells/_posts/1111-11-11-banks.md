HipSci has established a banking arrangement with [ECACC](https://www.phe-culturecollections.org.uk/) for distribution of cell
lines to academic researchers, and have run a training course on using HipSci
cells with ECACC and potential downstream users. We also have an agreement
with [EBiSC](http://www.ebisc.org/) for future distribution to commercial (as well as
academic) researchers
