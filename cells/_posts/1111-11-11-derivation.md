Since initiation of the project, HipSci has developed from scratch a pipeline
to derive, expand and bank iPSC lines on a production scale. 

iPSC lines are produced in the Cellular
Genetics and Phenotyping facility (CGaP) at the Sanger Institute, which opened
in February 2013 with HipSci as its initial primary project.
right).

Three candidate lines per donor are picked
after reprogramming, from which one, or in a limited number of cases two, are
selected based on quality control (QC) assays.

HipSci is currently selecting
10 lines per week for expansion, experimental assays and banking.
This throughput will generate approximately 400 cell lines by the end of 2015.
