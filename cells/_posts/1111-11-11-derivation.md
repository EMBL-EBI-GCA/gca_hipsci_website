Since initiation of the project, HipSci has developed from scratch a pipeline
to derive, expand and bank iPSC lines on a production scale. 

iPSC lines are produced in the Cellular
Genetics and Phenotyping facility (CGaP) at the Sanger Institute, which opened
in February 2013 with HipSci as its initial primary project.

Two candidate lines per donor are picked
after reprogramming, from which one is
selected based on quality control (QC) assays. For cell lines derived during
the earliest phases of the project, three lines per donor were picked as candidates,
and in some cases two of these were selected for banking.

HipSci is currently selecting
10 lines per week for expansion, experimental assays and banking.
This throughput will generate approximately 400 cell lines by the end of 2015.
