HipSci has established two separate banking arrangements:

* [ECACC](https://www.phe-culturecollections.org.uk/products/celllines/ipsc/search.jsp?&dosearch=true&IPSC_CellLineSuppliedBy_FACET=SGlwU2Np) for distribution of cell lines to academic researchers.
* [EBiSC](https://www.phe-culturecollections.org.uk/products/celllines/ipsc/search.jsp?&dosearch=true&IPSC_CellLineSuppliedBy_FACET=RUJpU0M&IPSC_Depositor_FACET=V2VsbGNvbWUgVHJ1c3QgU2FuZ2VyIEluc3RpdHV0ZQ) for distribution to commercial (as well as academic) researchers for a smaller subset of HipSci lines.
