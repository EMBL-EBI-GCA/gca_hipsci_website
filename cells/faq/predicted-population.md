title: What populations are represented in HipSci?

The vast majority of HipSci cell lines are from donors of British ancestry, but some are from other genetic backgrounds. The following plot shows the first two principal components of the HIPSC donor genotypes (‘h’ symbol) overlaid with 1000 genomes populations (coloured hexagons).

A classifier (random forest) on the first 3 principal components was used to assign the most likely population to each HIPSCI donor.
