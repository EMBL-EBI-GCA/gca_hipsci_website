<h3>Can HipSci make iPSC lines for some donors I would like iPSCs from?</h3>

<p>HipSci cannot make iPSC lines for any new cohorts. We have completed recruitment for all donors samples we are able to derive iPSCs from.</p>

<p>The CGaP facility at the Wellcome trust Sanger Institute, where the iPSC lines are derived for HipSci, is not a fee for service facility. The facility will only consider proposals for the derivation of iPSC's, if this is done as part of a collaboration with a Sanger PI.  </p>
