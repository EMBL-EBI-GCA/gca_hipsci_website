title: Can HipSci make iPSC lines for some donors I would like iPSCs from?

HipSci cannot make iPSC lines for any new cohorts. We have completed recruitment for all donor samples we are able to derive iPSCs from.

The CGaP facility at the Wellcome trust Sanger Institute, where the iPSC lines are derived for HipSci, is not a fee for service facility. The facility will only consider proposals for the derivation of iPSC's, if this is done as part of a collaboration with a Sanger PI.
