<h3>I would like to know the Sendai status, passage number, culturing conditions of the line I am interested in. Where do I find this cell line specific information?</h3>
<p>Every iPSC line we have already banked will have a CoA available. If a line has not been banked yet, then the CoA will only become available once banked.</p>
<p>To locate the CoA, click on the hyperlinked cell line name. This will display the following information.</p>

<p>If the line has been banked, the CoA can be found as a downloadable PDF next to "Certificate of analysis"</p>
