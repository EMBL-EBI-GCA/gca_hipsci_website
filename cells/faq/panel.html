<p>For new users of our iPSC resource, we have composed two panels (feeder-dependent and feeder-free) of lines from the HipSci iPSC collection that we would recommend. These lines have been selected based on their high pluritest scores, low CNVâ€™s, comprehensively characterised assay data, and their differentiation potential.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="six columns panel-table">
    <h4>Feeder-free panel</h4>
    <table class="u-full-width"><tbody>
      {% for line in site.data.panel.ff %}
      <tr>
        <td><a href="/lines/#/lines/{{line.name}}">{{line.name}}</a></td>
        <td><a class="button button-primary" target="_blank" href="http://www.phe-culturecollections.org.uk/products/celllines/ipsc/detail.jsp?refId={{line.catalog}}&collection=ecacc_ipsc">Purchase</a></td>
      </tr>
      {% endfor %}
      <tr>
    </tbody></table>
  </div>
  <div class="six columns panel-table">
    <h4>Feeder-dependent panel</h4>
    <table class="u-full-width"><tbody>
      {% for line in site.data.panel.fd %}
      <tr>
        <td><a href="/lines/#/lines/{{line.name}}">{{line.name}}</a></td>
