<h3>Do I need to obtain my own ethics to work on these lines?</h3>
<p>IPSC lines purchased from ECACC or EBiSC do not require further ethical approval for use in research. When purchasing a HipSci line, you will find the full terms of use within the Material transfer agreement, which must be completed and signed by your host institution.</p>
<p> If these lines are being purchased from countries outside of the UK, you may need to find out if there are any local governance or ethical requirements you need to fulfil for the use of these lines.</p>
