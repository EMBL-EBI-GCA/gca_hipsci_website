<h3>How do I know what is a good line to pick?</h3>
<p>For new users of our iPSC resource, we have composed two panels (feeder-dependent and feeder-free) of lines from the HipSci iPSC collection that we would recommend. These lines have been selected based on their high pluritest scores, low CNVâ€™s, comprehensively characterised assay data, and their differentiation potential.</p>

<p>If you are looking for the associated assay data for these lines, simply click on the line name and it will take you to the data files you can download.</p>
