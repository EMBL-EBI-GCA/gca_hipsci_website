<h3>Where do I find the mutation for the rare disease line?</h3>
<p>Each cell line is extensively characterised. The mutation affecting any particular selected disease line, can therefore be found in the accompanying data sets. For access to these data, researchers must register and apply for access via WTSI's <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/legal/DAA/MasterController">Electronic Data Access Mechanism.</a></p>
