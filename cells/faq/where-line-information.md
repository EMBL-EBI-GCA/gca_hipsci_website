Every iPSC line we have already banked will have a CoA available. If a line has not been banked yet, then the CoA will only become available once banked.

To locate the CoA, click on the hyperlinked cell line name. This will display the following information.

If the line has been banked, the CoA can be found as a downloadable PDF next to "Certificate of analysis"
