title: What is the difference between managed access and open access lines?

Lines from our normal healthy donors fall under either managed or open access, based on the ethics approval number they were collected under. All HipSci iPSC lines from donors with rare diseases fall under managed access.

**Managed access**

For a managed access line, the recipient agrees that any genetic or genomic data it generates from use of the Cell Lines will be held securely and only used in biomedical research, and will only be made available to third party researchers under a Data Access Agreement at least as stringent as the [Data Access Agreement](/documents/hipsci-daa.pdf) for data from the same Cell Lines at the EGA submitted by Sanger. Sanger encourages submission of genomic data to a managed access repository such as the EGA or dbGAP, with access being restricted to use for biomedical research and subject to a Data Access Agreement at least as stringent as that for data from the same Cell Lines at the EGA submitted by Sanger. For the avoidance of doubt, genetic or genomic data from the Cell Lines may not be made available on the open internet.

**Open access**

For an open access line the recipient agrees not to make any attempt to identify the original donors of the Cell Lines. Recipient agrees to remove any data mapping to the Y chromosome (including sequencing reads, genotypes etc.) before making genetic or genomic data available to third parties. Once this has been done, data may be made available for biomedical research in an open access fashion, permitting redistribution of derived data sets.
