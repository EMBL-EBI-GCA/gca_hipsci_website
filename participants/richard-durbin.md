### Richard Durbin

Richard Durbin completed a first degree in Mathematics, then a PhD in Molecular Biology.  Following a postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford University he returned to Cambridge in 1990 at the start of the Human Genome Project. There he became a founding member of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, where he has been ever since,  participating in multiple large scale research projects.  He is currently interested in computational methods to process high throughput genome data, and in using them to study genome evolution and gene function.  Richard is an Honorary Professor in Computational Genomics at Cambridge University, a Member of EMBO and a Fellow of the Royal Society.
