HipSci has generated iPS cell lines from donors diagnosed with monogenic diabetes.
Exeter Medical School contributed the tissue samples to the HipSci project.

Monogenic forms of diabetes are associated to a mutation in a single gene of the individual.
Many different genes can be responsible, and HipSci's diabetes cell lines come from
individuals in which the disease-causing mutation is not in the same gene across the cohort of individuals.

This cohort is one of many genetic disease cohorts in the HipSci project. 
IPSC technology provides opportunity for modelling
human genetic diseases in the culture dish, for developing therapeutic agents
and for screening of potential drugs.  Cell lines reprogrammed from the somatic
cells of disease-carrying tissue donors can be differentiated into the
disease-relevant tissues, which are not otherwise easily obtained from patients.
