HipSci has generated iPS cell lines from donors diagnosed with Bardet-biedl
syndrome. University College London contributed the tissue samples to the HipSci project.

> Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a ciliopathy with multisystem involvement.
> Its prevalence in Europe is estimated at between 1/125,000 and 1/175,000.
> This disorder is characterized by a combination of clinical signs: obesity,
> pigmentary retinopathy, post-axial polydactyly, polycystic kidneys,
> hypogenitalism, and learning disabilities, many of which appear several
> years after disease onset. Clinical expression is variable but most
> patients manifest the majority of clinical signs during the disease course.
> Pigmentary retinopathy is the only constant clinical sign after childhood.
> BBS may also be associated with several other manifestations including
> diabetes, hypertension, congenital cardiopathy and Hirschsprung disease
> (see this term). The wide clinical spectrum observed in BBS is associated
> with significant genetic heterogeneity. The disorder is transmitted mainly
> in an autosomal recessive manner but oligogenic inheritance has been
> reported in some cases. To date, mutations in 12 different genes (BBS1 to
> BBS12) have been identified as being responsible for this phenotype. These
> genes code for proteins involved in the development and function of primary
> cilia. Absence or dysfunction of BBS proteins results in ciliary anomalies
> in organs such as the kidney or eye. However, the relationship between
> symptoms and ciliary dysfunction remains obscure for some of the clinical
> manifestations of BBS. Recognition of the clinical picture is important as
> the diagnosis can be confirmed by molecular analysis, allowing appropriate
> genetic counseling for family members and possible prenatal diagnosis. The
> differential diagnosis should include the AlstrÃ¶m, McKusick-Kaufmann and
> Meckel-Gruber syndromes (see these terms). Patients with BBS will need
> multidisciplinary medical care. The renal abnormalities are the main
> life-threatening manifestations because they can lead to end-stage renal
> failure and require renal transplantation. Progressive vision loss due to
> retinal dystrophy, together with moderate intellectual deficit (when
> present), behavioral anomalies, hypomimia and obesity will affect the
> social life of these patients.
