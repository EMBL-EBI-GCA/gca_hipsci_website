HipSci has generated iPS cell lines from donors diagnosed with Bardet-biedl
syndrome. University College London contributed the tissue samples to the HipSci project.

Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a ciliopathy with multisystem involvement.
It is an inherited genetic disorder, for which mutations in many different genes
can be responsible. HipSci's BBS cell lines ceom from individuals in which the
disease-causing mutation is not in the same gene across the cohort of individuals.

This cohort is one of many genetic disease cohorts in the HipSci project. 
IPSC technology provides opportunity for modelling
human genetic diseases in the culture dish, for developing therapeutic agents
and for screening of potential drugs.  Cell lines reprogrammed from the somatic
cells of disease-carrying tissue donors can be differentiated into the
disease-relevant tissues, which are not otherwise easily obtained from patients.
